    "_______________\n",
    "In 2018 the NYC 311 system had 44,023,630 customer requests for services or information.\n",
    "\n",
    "<a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/311/311-sets-new-record-in-2018.page\">These interactions</a>  included everything from making noise complaints and requesting city records, to getting information about city services. The city began publishing an online database of service requests in 2010 in order to both enhance visibility around public services and provide a better method of tracking ongoing service requests. Through this portal customers can access information on both active and inactive service requests including the status of a complaint, what actions were taken to remedy the situation and a large amount of technical data regarding the complaint.

    "## Business Problem \n",
    "________________________\n",
    "On average the City of New York will receive 2.1 million Service Requests through its 311 system each year. Everything from potholes to noise complaints flows into the queu of pending SRs. The city must process, assign and complete the required actions for each and every SR it recieves. This is of course in addition to dealing with emergency situations, regular maintenance and building infrastructure and programs for the future of the city. Naturally this means that extraordinary strain is placed on city services which are frequently stretched to the limit and need to utilize every ounce of manpower and funding available to them. \n",
    "\n",
    "One of the fundamental challenges for successful resource allocation at this scale is constistency. Having appropriate resources avaiable for departments to handle the flow of complaints is necessary to keep the system running smoothly, the bosses happy and the citizens content. Unfortunately the volume of requests received each day is far from consistent. During its slowest day on record the 311 system received 1680 SRs, which for a city of of 8.4 million seems like a reasonable figure. On its busiest day however the system received 11735 requests. Astute observers may notice the slight 7 fold difference in daily SR volume experienced by this system. Which leads to an interesting question: how do you effectively allocate resources, staffing and operating budgets when you may be dealing with 2000 complaints one day and 11000 the next?"

    "## Business Question\n",
    "_________________________\n",
    "The problem outlined above centers on uncertainty in SR volume. While randomness is inherent to any system so complex and human dependent as city services there are still patterns within the usage of the New York 311 system. The amount of uncertainty surrounding SR volume can be dramatically reduced through understanding these patterns and using them to forecast future SR volume. Reducing the uncertainty of these numbers will help NYC better allocate its resources and effectively serve the community. Answering these questions will be at the core of effectively understanding and forecasting SR volume:\n",
    "1. What trends, seasonal changes and cycles effect SR volume for the NYC 311 system?\n",
    "2. What are the traits/predictors of variance in SR volume not explained by the factors listed above?\n",
    "\n",
    "A multitude of other questions can be devised as part of these larger questions or as supporting information for the analysis. However the goal of this project centers on these two questions."

    "_______________________________\n",
    "The goals of this analysis are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understand the long term trends, seasonality and cycles present within the data.\n",
    "    - Perform EDA and timeseries decomposition to understand these components. \n",
    "2. Effectively model future SR volume on a long timeframe in coarse detail. \n",
    "    - Predict SR volume based on understanding the above up to a year out.\n",
    "    - This model can be used to assist in longer term budgeting and planning by providing reasonable projections of future SR volume. \n",
    "3. Create a forecasting tool to accurately predict SR volume in the near term with a high degree of precision capable of predicting SR volume 3-4 weeks ahead. \n",
    "    - Use the modeling for #2 combined with more advanced Neural Network techniques to make a more powerful and accurate, but nearsighted, forecast of SR volume.\n",
    "    - This model can be used to make short term staffing decisions such as employee scheduling. And assist in effective resource allocation in a more granular but smaller scale than the previous model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "These goals are significant in the amount of effort and time needed to understand and accurately model them. Because this analysis is complex the scope of the project will be limited as described in the next section."

    "## Scope \n",
    "_________________________________\n",
    "Between 2010 and 2021 the NYC 311 Open Data system logged 26.4 million service requests. Which equates to roughly 2.3 million requests for each of the 11.5 years the system has been operational. To keep the scope of this project to a reasonable level there will be three major limitations to the dataset used for this analysis.\n",
    "1. Timeframe - 2010 to 2019\n",
    "    - Only complaints falling within these years will be considered for analysis.\n",
    "        - This timeframe was chosen as it gives ample data for training, validating and testing the models. \n",
    "        - Additionally the Covid-19 pandemic caused issues with the 311 System which lead to inconsistent data collection.\n",
    "          This timeframe avoids these potential issues and ensures that once conditions return to normal the model will be as accurate as possible.\n",
    "2. Complaint Status\n",
    "    - Only complaints with a \"Closed\" status will be considered for analysis, meaning that only those complaints that are considered resolved by the responsible agency will be analyzed.\n",
    "3. Timeseries Limitation\n",
    "    - Due to the size of the dataset and the constraints placed on this project the timeseries analysis will be constrained to the single dimension of SR volume. \n",
    "        - The dataset comes with many columns that are unnecessary for the purposes of this analysis. The dataset will be cleaned normally to give the purest possible data before being reduced into the timeseries format required."
